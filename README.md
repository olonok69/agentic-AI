# Agentic AI: Prompting Techniques for Effective LLM Reasoning and Planning

## Overview

This repository contains the materials for the Udacity course on **Agentic AI**, focusing on advanced prompting techniques to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, planning, and interaction. The course explores various prompting strategies that enable LLMs to act more autonomously and effectively in complex tasks.

Through hands-on exercises and Jupyter notebooks, you'll learn to craft prompts that guide LLMs through structured reasoning processes, adopt specific personas, and apply techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReACT prompting.

## Course Structure

- **Content:** Videos and subtitles introducing core concepts of prompting for reasoning and planning

### 2. Role-Based Prompting
- **Notebooks:**
  - `lesson-1-role-based-prompting.ipynb`: Hands-on exercise on role-based prompting with historical figure personas
  - `solution-lesson-1-role-based-prompting.ipynb`: Complete solution for the role-based prompting lesson
- **Content:** Videos and subtitles covering role-based prompting techniques

### 3. Introducing Chain-of-Thought and ReACT Prompting
- **Content:** Introductory videos and subtitles on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReACT prompting methodologies

### 4. Chain-of-Thought and ReACT Prompting with Python
- **Content:** Videos and subtitles demonstrating practical implementation of CoT and ReACT techniques

- Familiarity with machine learning concepts (helpful but not required)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd agentic-ai
   ```

2. **Install required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install openai python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the desired module folder
