        "\n",
        "Important context and definitions for dietary restrictions:\n",
        "- Vegetarian: No meat, poultry, fish, or seafood. May include eggs and dairy.\n",
        "- Vegan: No animal products whatsoever, including meat, dairy, eggs, honey.\n",
        "- Gluten-free: No wheat, barley, rye, or derivatives. Note that regular all-purpose flour contains gluten.\n",
        "- Dairy-free: No milk, cheese, butter, cream, or other dairy products.\n",
        "- Nut-free: No tree nuts or peanuts.\n",
        "- Egg-free: No eggs or products containing eggs.\n",
        "- Low-sodium: Limited salt and naturally high-sodium ingredients.\n",
        "- Keto: Very low carbohydrate, high fat, moderate protein.\n",
        "- Paleo: No grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar, or processed foods.\n",

        "- Mark a restriction as \"undeterminable\" if you lack sufficient information (e.g., exact type of broth, potential cross-contamination).\n",

        "- For baked goods, assume standard ingredients unless specified (e.g., all-purpose flour is not gluten-free).\n",
        "- For ambiguous ingredients, err on the side of \"undeterminable\" rather than making assumptions.\n",
